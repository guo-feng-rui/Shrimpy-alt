# üß† Smart Weighting System - Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide shows you how to test the **Smart Weighting System** that uses AI-powered semantic analysis instead of rigid keyword matching.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Web Interface Test
Visit: `http://localhost:3001/test-smart-weighting`

**Features:**
- Interactive test interface
- Real-time weight calculation
- AI analysis visualization
- Goal-based testing
- Visual weight breakdown

### 2. API Testing
Test the API directly:

```bash
# Test a single query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-smart-weighting \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "I need someone who can help me scale my business"}'

# Test with user goal
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-smart-weighting \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Looking for experienced developers",
    "goal": {
      "type": "startup_building",
      "description": "Building a startup team",
      "keywords": [],
      "preferences": {}
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Command Line Testing
Run the Node.js test script:

```bash
# Test smart weighting system
node test-smart-weighting.js

# Test comparison between systems
node test-comparison.js
```

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ambiguous Queries
**Test Queries:**
- "I need someone who can help me scale my business"
- "Looking for a mentor who understands the startup world"
- "Want to connect with people who are passionate about AI"

**Expected Results:**
- Smart system should identify semantic intent beyond keywords
- Should show different weight distributions than keyword system
- AI analysis should provide context and urgency

### Scenario 2: Vague Queries
**Test Queries:**
- "Need someone with experience in the field"
- "Anyone working on interesting projects?"
- "Someone who can help me figure this out"

**Expected Results:**
- Should handle context-dependent language
- Pattern recognition should identify implicit intent
- Contextual analysis should assess specificity

### Scenario 3: Complex Multi-faceted Queries
**Test Queries:**
- "Specifically looking for a senior React developer with 5+ years experience"
- "Looking for startup founders with technical backgrounds"
- "Want to connect with experienced professionals in fintech"

**Expected Results:**
- Should balance multiple aspects intelligently
- AI should identify primary vs secondary intents
- Goal adjustments should modify weights appropriately

### Scenario 4: Urgency and Specificity
**Test Queries:**
- "I'm desperate to find someone who can help me with this urgent project"
- "Maybe someone who kind of knows about machine learning?"
- "Eventually want to connect with Python developers"

**Expected Results:**
- Urgency detection should prioritize specific aspects
- Specificity analysis should boost primary intent
- Context should influence weight distribution

## üìä Expected Improvements

### vs Keyword-Based System

| Aspect | Keyword System | Smart System | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Ambiguous Queries** | Poor | Excellent | +40-60% |
| **Context Understanding** | None | Full | +100% |
| **Urgency Detection** | None | Intelligent | +100% |
| **Goal Integration** | Basic | Advanced | +50% |
| **Fallback Handling** | None | Graceful | +100% |

### Weight Distribution Examples

#### Query: "I need someone who can help me scale my business"

**Keyword System:**
- skills: 20%
- experience: 20%
- company: 20%
- location: 15%
- network: 15%
- goal: 5%
- education: 5%

**Smart System:**
- skills: 15%
- experience: 30%
- company: 35%
- location: 5%
- network: 5%
- goal: 5%
- education: 5%

**Improvement:** Recognizes "scale my business" as company/experience focus, not generic skills.

- [ ] Error handling graceful
- [ ] Concurrent requests handled

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Server Not Starting**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

**2. AI Analysis Failing**
- Check Azure OpenAI configuration
- Verify environment variables
- Check network connectivity
- Review API rate limits

**3. Weights Not Calculating**
- Check console for errors
- Verify SmartWeighting import
- Test individual methods
- Check TypeScript compilation

**4. Comparison Not Working**
- Ensure both systems available
- Check import paths
- Verify function signatures
- Test individual components

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/test-smart-weighting

# Test AI analysis endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/analyze-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test query"}'

# Run Node.js tests
node test-smart-weighting.js
node test-comparison.js
```

## üìà Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Accuracy:** Smart system should show 40-60% improvement for ambiguous queries
- **Speed:** Response time < 2 seconds
- **Reliability:** 95%+ success rate
- **Fallback:** 100% graceful degradation

### Qualitative

- Fallback systems activate when needed

### Areas for Improvement
- Response times > 2 seconds
- AI analysis fails frequently
- Weights don't reflect query intent
- Goal adjustments too aggressive/weak

### Expected Output Example

```
üìù Query: "I need someone who can help me scale my business"

ü§ñ AI Analysis:
   Primary Intent: company
   Urgency: medium
   Specificity: general
